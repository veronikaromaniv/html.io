<h3>The world moves on, another day another drama, <strong>drama</strong><br>
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is <strong><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg18Kf4en2o" target = "_blank">karma</a></strong></h3>

<p><li>Taylor seems to be nodding to a Britney Spears lyric from “Piece of Me,” a song that appeared on her 2007 album Blackout:<br>

<em>I’m Miss Bad Media Karma<br>
Another day, another drama</em>
</li></p>
<p><li>Taylor had always been a believer in karma — in her “73 Questions” interview with Vogue, she said “karma is real.” <br>In Bad Blood, she further references karma, singing:“All these things will catch up to you”.</li></p>
